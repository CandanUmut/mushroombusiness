🍄 Mushroom & Herbal Wellness Microfarm – Project Repository

🌱 Vision

Create a self-sufficient, spiritually-aligned, and eco-conscious microfarm in a Turkish village that produces gourmet and medicinal mushrooms, healing herbs, wellness products, and sustainable bio-materials.

💡 Core Goals
	•	Cultivate mushrooms (oyster, lion’s mane, turkey tail, reishi, etc.)
	•	Grow and dry herbs for joints, teas, tinctures
	•	Produce biodegradable materials from mycelium
	•	Establish fully automated fruiting chambers
	•	Develop natural medicine, incense, and sleep kits
	•	Integrate with existing Hope & Frequency Labs

⸻

📦 Initial Setup Requirements

🏠 Space
	•	~50 m² village home or barn
	•	2-3 rooms for cultivation and fruiting
	•	Electric and water access

🧰 Equipment & Supplies
	•	Transparent greenhouse tents (2x)
	•	Ultrasonic humidifiers (1 per tent)
	•	Exhaust fan with ducting
	•	AC or heater (controlled environment)
	•	Hygrometers & thermometers
	•	Grow racks/shelves
	•	Power extension & smart plug
	•	Cameras for monitoring (USB or WiFi)
	•	Spray bottles, gloves, buckets

🍄 Growing Supplies
	•	Mushroom spawn (culture syringes or liquid culture)
	•	Substrates:
	•	Oyster: Straw, coco coir, coffee grounds
	•	Lion’s Mane: Hardwood pellets, soy hulls
	•	Turkey Tail: Hardwood sawdust
	•	CVG mix (coco coir + vermiculite + gypsum)
	•	Grain spawn (rye or millet jars)

⸻

🧪 Workflow

1. Inoculation
	•	Sterilize jars (pressure cooker or boiling)
	•	Inject culture into grain jars
	•	Wait 2-3 weeks for full colonization

2. Bulk Substrate Preparation
	•	Hydrate and pasteurize substrate (hot water bath)
	•	Mix colonized grain into substrate in grow bags

3. Fruiting
	•	Move bags to fruiting tent when ready
	•	Maintain 85-95% RH, 20-24°C
	•	Monitor pinning, misting as needed
	•	Harvest 5-15 days later
